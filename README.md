# machine-status

## The idea
Our users want to know when a machine is on or off, loaded or unloaded. That will help them understand 

* how utilized their equipment is, 
* how long it takes to change tools, 
* if the equipment is under-loaded, then how to improve the efficiency.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm run start
```
